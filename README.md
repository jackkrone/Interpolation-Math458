# Varieties of Interpolation Project

### Overview
This is a project I completed in Numerical Methods (MATH 458) at USC. The task was to analyze the effect of different interpolation methods on animations. Interpolation is ubiquitous in digital animation, but there are various forms of interpolation, and they each have different effects, even if slight, on the appearance of a given animation. I animated a simple stick-figure bird in flight with polynomial interpolation, cubic spline interpolation, and linear spline interpolation.

### Getting started:
Start by downloading the writeup and skimming the overview of my work. On page 2 is a shot of each form of interpolation I used. The writeup states that by double-clicking on the image the viewer can view the animation. This no longer works as expected, so I included the original video files in this repo. Unfortunately, I lost the original animation that uses linear spline interpolation, and no longer have access to a MATLAB license to recreate it. I rendered the animation using Octave instead, and have included a screen recording of it in the repo. Note that this animation plays much slower than the other two.

All of the code I used to create these animations is included in the .m files.
